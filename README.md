# ECON-622-01
Over the past decade, we have seen a significant increase in the quality and availability of large datasets across all industries. This has led to new economic problems but also given an incredible opportunity for trained economists to leverage these new datasets to tackle existing problems in domains such as market design, pricing, incentives, social behavior. It triggered new ways to bring economic theory in practice by analyzing a vast array of data such as customer transactions, social media, streaming data from IoT devices, crowdsourced data, etcâ€¦ The goal of this course is to introduce students who have foundational knowledge in economics and econometrics to not only the underpinning theory but also hands-on practical application of new analytics methods at the intersection between statistics, applied economic theory, computer science and machine learning (PLO-3). It aims to bridge domains that often have their own formalism and usually taught and applied independently.  The focus of the course will be on algorithms and model estimations to solve concrete, real-world analytics and business problems (PLO-2 / PLO-4). Lecture sessions will rely on a series of code examples in Python (Jupyter notebooks) to give students an opportunity to get familiar with computational tools and machine learning libraries and build and run methods and estimations in practice.
